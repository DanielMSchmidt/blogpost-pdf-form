# Demo for PDF Forms

This is a demo for [a PDF Form blogpost of mine](https://medium.com/@dschmidt1992/rebuilding-a-pdf-form-with-react-native-9718e7419c2c#.9mo8kr3di). Feel free to ask any questions
on the post itself or as an issue.

## Setup

0. Have RN setup on your device
1. run `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. work with it like with any other RN project
